| Project Completion | Final Delivery and Sign-off | 5% | 42,020 |

### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could potentially impact the budget. We have identified the following areas of uncertainty or risk and propose mitigation strategies:

1. Scope Creep:
   - Risk: Additional features or changes requested during development.
   - Mitigation: Implement a strict change control process. Any changes to the scope will be evaluated for their impact on the budget and timeline.

2. Integration Complexity:
   - Risk: Unforeseen challenges in integrating with existing client systems.
   - Mitigation: Allocate additional buffer time for integration. If integration proves more straightforward, this buffer can be used for additional testing or feature refinement.

3. AI Model Training:
   - Risk: Extended time required for AI model training and fine-tuning.
   - Mitigation: Begin with a pre-trained model and allocate sufficient time for customization. Monitor progress closely and adjust resources as needed.

4. Data Quality and Availability:
   - Risk: Poor quality or insufficient data for RAG implementation.
   - Mitigation: Conduct a thorough data assessment early in the project. If data quality issues are identified, we may need to allocate additional resources for data cleaning and preparation.

5. Regulatory Compliance:
   - Risk: Changes in regulatory requirements or additional compliance needs.
   - Mitigation: Stay informed about relevant regulations. Budget includes a compliance review, but additional costs may be incurred for unforeseen requirements.

6. Third-party Dependencies:
   - Risk: Price changes or discontinuation of critical third-party services.
   - Mitigation: Identify alternative providers and include flexibility in the architecture to switch if necessary.

7. Exchange Rate Fluctuations:
   - Risk: For international clients, exchange rate changes could affect the budget.
   - Mitigation: Consider setting the contract in a stable currency or including an exchange rate clause.

To manage these risks and uncertainties:

1. We have included a 10% contingency in the budget.
2. Monthly budget reviews will be conducted to track spending and forecast potential overruns.
3. A change request process will be implemented to evaluate and approve any changes that may impact the budget.
4. Clear communication channels will be established to quickly address and resolve any budget-related issues.
