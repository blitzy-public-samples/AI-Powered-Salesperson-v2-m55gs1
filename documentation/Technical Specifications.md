3. The RAG system retrieves relevant information from internal databases, files, and knowledge bases.
4. The Quote Generation Engine combines user requirements, RAG output, and SKU catalog data to create accurate quotes.
5. Generated quotes are formatted and presented to the user, with options for export and further actions.
6. All interactions are logged and synchronized with the integrated CRM and ERP systems.
7. Administrators can monitor system performance, manage users, and configure system behavior through the Admin Control Panel.

Key technologies employed in the system include:

- Frontend: React.js for the web interface
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js for API services
- Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for semi-structured data
- AI/ML: TensorFlow or PyTorch for NLP and machine learning models
- Containerization: Docker with Kubernetes for orchestration
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services
- Caching: Redis for high-performance data caching
- Search: Elasticsearch for efficient data retrieval
- Monitoring: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and monitoring

The system is designed to be highly scalable, secure, and compliant with industry standards and regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. It aims to significantly improve the efficiency of the quoting process, enhance customer experience, and provide valuable insights through data analysis and reporting.
