Overview:
The product is an AI-powered salesperson chat system designed to ingest part requirements, retrieve relevant information from internal files/data using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and generate structured quotes. It will output the data in a structured format, including the company's SKU catalog, to streamline part quoting and ordering processes.

Key Features:
AI-Powered Requirement Ingestion:

Natural Language Interface: Users (customers/sales agents) can input part requirements via a chat interface in natural language.
Interactive Prompts: The chat system prompts users for missing or required attributes (e.g., dimensions, material, quantity) based on the part being requested.
Autonomous Questioning: AI-driven prompts to clarify vague or incomplete requirements.
Data Ingestion with RAG:

Internal File/Data Integration: The system leverages RAG to pull relevant data from internal company files such as past quotes, order history, product specs, or design drawings.
Customizable Data Sources: System admins can configure RAG to prioritize specific data sources (e.g., ERP, CRM, previous quotes) for contextual information.
Dimension Extraction: AI can analyze and extract dimensions from drawings or other input files to feed directly into the quoting system.
Quote Generation:

SKU Catalog Integration: The system pulls from the company's SKU catalog to map part requirements to corresponding SKUs and pricing data.
Dynamic Pricing: Generates a quote based on real-time pricing, discounts, or custom pricing rules from the SKU catalog.
Bulk Order Discounts: Can adjust quotes based on quantity for large orders (e.g., tiered pricing, bulk order discounts).
Costing Tool Integration: Quotes take into account past data, operating criteria, and cost analysis from the company's costing tool.
Multiple Part Quotes: Handles complex queries for multiple parts and consolidates them into a single quote.
Structured Output:

Formatted Quote: The system outputs the quote in a structured format, clearly displaying:
Part Name/Description
SKU
Quantity
Unit Price
Total Price (with discounts if applicable)
Lead Time/Delivery Estimate
Any Additional Costs (e.g., shipping, taxes)
Export Options: The quote can be exported as a PDF, CSV, or sent via email directly to the customer or sales team.
User Management:

Salesperson or Customer Access: Sales reps or customers can both interact with the system to request quotes.
CRM Integration: Quotes are automatically logged and linked to existing customer profiles in the CRM system.
Versioning and Auditing:

Quote Versioning: Track revisions and changes to quotes over time.
Audit Trail: Maintain a full audit trail for compliance, showing who requested the quote, changes made, and final approval.
Customizable Rules and Filters:

Admin Controls: Company admins can configure the AI's behavior, setting rules for how quotes are generated, such as adding approval workflows or limiting quote generation based on inventory.
Filters for SKU Mapping: Custom filters can be applied to match specific product attributes to the most relevant SKU in the catalog.
